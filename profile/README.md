# Neural Data Science

This Github repository contains the course materials for multiple iterations of BIPN 162 (Neural Data Science). You can find a recent syllabus and the corresponding course materials in the BIPN162_WI24 repository.

Note that there are also private repositories containing assignment solutions and development of course materials. If you are a course instructor and would like access to those repositories, please reach out to Ashley Juavinett (ajuavine[at]ucsd.edu). 

I am also currently writing a neural data science textbook with Bradley Voytek, coming soon!

Using these materials? [Let me know on this Google Form!](https://forms.gle/HUxqyY2o7r74Eyko9)
